You would want have all your extra elisp stuff in a common place,
e.g. ~/.emacs.d/lisp/. 

The files da-kalendar.el and da-cal-tex.el should either be copied to
~/.emacs.d/lisp or you could clone the git repository and softlink the
the files. 

Cloning the repository and softlinking makes it easy to update to the
latest version, you would just a git pull once in a while.

On Linux (and possible Mac) the softlinks can be create using the
following commands:

   [user@linux lisp]$ ln -s ~/Projects/elisp/da-kalender.el .
   [user@linux lisp]$ ln -s ~/Projects/elisp/da-cal-tex.el .

On Windows you could use the mklink command:

   C:\Users\lunddsor\.emacs.d\lisp>mklink /H da-kalender.el c:\Projects\My\elisp\da-kalender.el
   Hardlink created for da-kalender.el <<===>> c:\Projects\My\elisp\da-kalender.el

   C:\Users\username\.emacs.d\lisp>mklink /H da-cal-tex.el c:\Projects\elisp\da-cal-tex.el
   Hardlink created for da-cal-tex.el <<===>> c:\Projects\My\elisp\da-cal-tex.el


The ~/.emacs.d/lisp/ directory should then be added to your load-path
using the following or similar in ~/.emacs

   (setq load-path
     (append load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")))


Then add the following to ~/.emacs

   ;; Load danish localization of calendar
   (load-file "da-kalender.el")

   ;; Load danish localization of the TeX calendar
   (load-file "da-cal-tex.el")

   ;; Override keybinding to weekly iso calendar
   (define-key calendar-mode-map (kbd "t w 3") 'da-cal-tex-cursor-week-iso)
